Destroyer (TheCore)
=========

A bigger new minigame plugin for bukkit.



You spawn in an arena above the void and your goal is to destroy the enemies beacon. There are classes and the reset is full automatic.



All features:

* arena system with lobby signs
* classes
* player stats
* teams
* commands for admins
* spectator mode
* fully automatical (auto restores map)
* clickable inventory menu for classes



The setup is pretty big though..



* `/tc createarena [name]`
* `/tc setboundaries {count} [name]`
* `/tc setspawn {count} [name]	`
* `/tc setlobby {count} [name]`
* `/tc setbeacon {count} [name]`
 

IMPORTANT: after you built the arena map:


* `/tcadmin savearena [name]`
