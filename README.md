Destroyer
=========

A bigger new minigame plugin for bukkit



You spawn in an arena above the void and your goal is to destroy the enemies beacon. There are classes and the reset is full automatic.



All features:

* arena system with lobby signs
* classes
* player stats
* teams
* commands for admins
* [maybe later on spectator mode]
* fully automatical (auto restores map)



The setup is pretty big though..



* /dest createarena [name]
* /dest setboundaries {count} [name]
* /dest setspawn {count} [name]	
* /dest setlobby {count} [name]
* /dest setbeacon {count} [name]
 

[IMPORTANT] after you built the arena map:


* /dest save [name]
